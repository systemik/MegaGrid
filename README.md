# How to use

Just pick the number of divisions (soft limit set to 5)

Pick the number of floors (soft limit to 15)

Start with low floor number (like 1 floor to see how it works)

Do not click creation of modifiers at first to ensure you have something workable in terms of computer capacity

If you want to start fresh, click the "DELETE ALL" button
