# Current issue (need to find a way to program those steps)
MISSING STEPS :
  In the LEVEL object Vertex Weight modifier you need to put the left cureve point to the top (X=0, Y=1)
  In the Texture Mask, You need to chosse the texture called "MaskTex"

# How to use
Just pick the number of divisions (soft limit set to 5)
Pick the number of floors (soft limit to 15)

Start low (like 1 floor to see how it works)
Do not click creation of modifiers at first to ensure you have something workable
If you want to start fresh, click the "DELETE ALL" button
